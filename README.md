# Tech stack
MEAN stack Vs. MERN stack project uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [Angular](https://angular.io) - is a TypeScript-based, free and open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations.
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) - is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server.
* [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) - is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of features and tools that simplify the process of building web applications and APIs.
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - a document-oriented, No-SQL database used to store the application data.
